 <div class="story">
  <p>A little lamb once jumped the fence to go on a great adventure. All he brought were dreams and some wool so he could be warm during the cold nights.</p>
  <p>This particular night it was very cold, since the sky showed all her stars. There was no warm cover of fluffy clouds to keep the lamb warm. But for this reason he had brought his wool.</p>
  <p>The nightsky, filled with tiny dots of white, was a beautiful sight! And the lamb trotted satisfied over the small dirt road leading towards the full moon.</p>
  <p>After a long walk, exhausted from staring at the stars, the little lamb sat down to get some rest. It didn't take long before he noticed a peculiar sound.</p>
  <p>This was no ordinary sound, it was magical, it tickled the lamb's ears. The little lamb started searching enthousiastic for the origin of the sweet sound.</p>
  <p>It wasn't for long untin the lamb saw a wonderful creature. It was bigger than the little lights in the sky, but smaller than the little lamb himself.</p>
  <p>They stared at each other on the dark, star lit road. The little creature's eyes sparkled. Of course, the lamb, as friendly as he is, took a few of his dreams he had brought.</p>
  <p>The sparkling eyes looked to the dreams the lamb had offered and accepted a rather comfortable one. Nothing is better than to share your dreams with someone.</p>
